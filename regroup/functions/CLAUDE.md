# Cloud Functions

This directory contains the Firebase Cloud Functions backend for Regroup. Loaded by Claude Code automatically when working inside `functions/`. See `../CLAUDE.md` for project-wide rules (including Stripe and PII policy).

## Commands

```bash
npm run build                   # TypeScript compile
npm test                        # Jest unit tests (run in band)
npm run test:watch              # Jest watch mode
npm run test:coverage           # Jest with coverage
npm run serve                   # Build + start Firebase emulator
npm run deploy                  # Deploy all functions
npm run deploy:batched          # Batch deploy (preferred for large changesets)
```

**Migration scripts** (run after build):

```bash
npm run migrate:dry-run         # Dry-run guest weeks migration
npm run migrate:run             # Apply guest weeks migration
npm run migrate:house-sub:dry-run
npm run migrate:house-sub:run
```

## Architecture

```
src/
  index.ts          Entry point — re-exports all functions
  init.ts           Firebase Admin SDK initialization (must be imported first)
  config.ts         Environment configuration
  callable/
    auth.ts         Auth callables (login helpers, token refresh)
    meetings.ts     Meeting management
    payments.ts     Payment initiation (house/guest payments)
    subscriptions.ts  Stripe subscriptions + Connect account management;
                      sendInviteEmails, sendConfirmationEmail
    oxford.ts       Oxford House management callables
    invitations.ts  createInvitation, peekInvitation, redeemInvitation
  triggers/
    firestore/      Firestore document write triggers
    rtdb/           Realtime Database triggers
    stripeConnect.ts  Stripe Connect account event triggers
  http/
    index.ts        HTTP-only endpoints (not callable)
    stripeWebhook.ts  Stripe webhook receiver (signature-verified)
  scheduled/
    officerTermReminder.ts
    overdueRentNotification.ts
    scheduledRentCollection.ts
  webhooks/
    universal.ts    Angular SSR handler (serves the web app)
  api/              Internal API helpers
  entities/         TypeScript interfaces (House, Guest, Subscription, etc.)
  types/            Shared type definitions
  util/             Shared utilities (logging, formatting)
  validation/       Input validation helpers
  scripts/          One-off migration scripts (not deployed as functions)
```

## Domain Rules

### Stripe amounts

All Stripe amounts are in **US cents** (integers). `50000` = $500.00. Convert only at the UI boundary — never inside function logic.

### Webhook security

`http/stripeWebhook.ts` uses Stripe signature verification (`stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`). Never process a webhook payload without verifying the signature first.

### Cross-product access (meetings, referrals)

Never add direct Firestore cross-queries to another product's database — route through recovery-api with service-key auth (`X-Service-Key`/`X-App-Id`/`X-User-Uid`). Firebase Auth ID tokens are project-scoped, so recovery-api (`recovery-platform`) cannot verify a `phoenix-cleanhouse` end-user token — cross-product calls are server-to-server, not end-user. (The former `callable/homegroups.ts` attendance bridge was removed as dead code — zero callers; regroup tracks attendance natively. Meeting **discovery** is being consolidated into recovery-api: see `docs/launch-readiness/recovery-api-meetings-stabilization-plan.md`.)

### Secrets

Service key lives in `service-key.json` (gitignored). Download from Firebase Console under `phoenix-cleanhouse`. Functions read secrets via environment config, not hardcoded values.
